## Challenge One

Prior to starting this challenge, I loaded in the data set, winnowed it to the variables outlined in the text, and did some preliminary analysis with `skim()`. I found that **Species1, Family1, Order1, Habitat, Trophic.Level,** and **Trophic Niche** are categorical while the rest are numeric.

``` r
d <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-datasets/refs/heads/main/AVONETdataset1.csv", col_names = TRUE)
d <- d |>
  select(Species1,Family1, Order1, Beak.Width, Beak.Depth, Beak.Length_Culmen, Tarsus.Length, Wing.Length, Tail.Length, Mass, Habitat, Migration, Trophic.Level,Trophic.Niche, Primary.Lifestyle, Min.Latitude,Max.Latitude,Centroid.Latitude,Range.Size) 
  mutate(Migration = as.factor(Migration)) #winnowing the dataset and changing migration into a factor
skim(d)
```

I also transformed `Migration` into a factor during this stage through `as.factor()` because it was more convenient to combine these into a single piped line of code.

### Step One

Starting off, I used `ggplot()` to draft up two quick boxplots to visualize how mass interacted with different kinds of trophic level and migration type. Visually, this immediately distinguished scavengers as a trophic level with much higher average mass than other levels; however, further analyses are needed to bring out the complexity of this comparison.

![](challenge1.11)

![](challenge1.12)

``` r
(p1 <- ggplot(data = d |> drop_na(Trophic.Level),
              aes(x = Trophic.Level, y = log(Mass))) +
    geom_boxplot())#boxplot for log(Mass) by trophic level
(p2 <- ggplot(data = d |> drop_na(Migration),
              aes(x = Migration, y = log(Mass))) +
    geom_boxplot()) #boxplot for log(Mass) by migration
```

### Step Two

Next, I ran linear models through `lm()` on the same comparisons as above. Using `summary()` I found that both models produce significantly high F-statistics that have p-values low enough to disprove the null hypothesis.

-   (m1) **F-statistic** =*78.42 on 3*

    -   **p-value** *\< 2.2e-16*

-   (m2) **F-statistic =** *144.5 on 2*

    -   **p-value -** *\< 2.2e-16*

Furthermore, when looking deeper at `m2`, we can see that the reference level is `1`, as it's the only Migration class not mentioned in the summary. Taking that into account, birds who fall into group 1 have statistically different average masses than birds who fall into group 2 (p-value **\<2.2e-16**) or group 3 (p-value = **3.02e-13**).

``` r
(m1 <- lm(log(Mass) ~ Trophic.Level, data = d)) 
(m2 <- lm(log(Mass) ~ Migration, data = d)) 
summary(m1) #the f-statistic is high enough to suggest that mass is associated trophic level #p-value of <2.2e-16
summary(m2) ##the f-statistic is high enough to suggest that mass is associated trophic level #p-value of <2.2e-16
#migration 1, the reference level, is significantly different from both migration2 (p <2e-16) and migration3 (p 3.02e-13)
```

Releveling Migration to `2` and rerunning the model as a new object, we can see that in addition to the highly significant difference between the average mass of birds in group 1 and group 2 noted previously, there is highly significant difference between between the average mass of birds in group 2 and 3 (p-value = **6.67e-09**).

``` r
d <- d |> mutate(Migration = relevel(Migration, ref = "2")) #switching ref level
(m22 <- lm(log(Mass) ~ Migration, data = d)) #comparing with new levels
summary(m22) #migration 2 is significantly different from both migration1 (p <2e-16) and migration3 (p 6.67e-09)
```

### Step Three

Rerunning `m2` as a `aov()` function allows me to then run `TukeyHSD()` to run post-hoc examinations on the results from `m2`. Specifically, I use a Tukey Honest Significant Differences Test to see which groups within migration differ significantly. Considering the test produces p-values of 0.00 for each group, it is safe to say that **all groups have significantly different average mass** (once logged to account for abnormal distributions).

``` r
m2 <- aov(log(Mass)~ Migration, data = d)
posthoc <- TukeyHSD(m2, which = "Migration", ordered = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)
posthoc  # all migration classes significantly differ
```

### Step Four

Finally, I load in the `:infer:` library to run permutations on the model so I can get a p-value for the observed F-statistic of `m1`.

Breaking this down, I first create the `logMass` variable from the logged `Mass` variable in the original dataset. This way I can account for its abnormal distribution while also using `specify()` .

``` r
library(infer)
d <- d |> mutate(logMass = log(Mass)) # creating logMass so that specify can work
```

Then I get the F-statistic by running `m1` as an `aov()` function then piping it to the `broom::tidy()` and `filter` functions to pull out the f-statistic for `"Trophic.Level"`.

``` r
original.F <- aov(log(Mass) ~ Trophic.Level, data = d) |>
  broom::tidy() |>
  filter(term == "Trophic.Level") #getting the f-statistic
```

Saving that as an object, I use a piped sequence of `specify()`, `hypothesize()`, `generate()`, and `calculate()` to get 1000 permutations of the F-statistic under the assumption that a bird's mass and trophic level are independent of each other. This made a tibble with 1000 different versions of an F-statistic from a test where any association between the variables had been broken.

``` r
permuted.F <- d |>
  specify(logMass ~ Trophic.Level) |>
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |>
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") |>
  calculate(stat = "F")
```

To get the final p-value, I used `get_p_value` by comparing the original F-statistic I drew out earlier in this step piped from the `permuted.F` tibble. This compared the changes of the observed F-statistic being found in the distribution created by the tibble. In this case, the **p-value equals 0.00** suggesting that our results would be highly unlikely to have been caused by independent variables

``` r
(p.value <- permuted.F |> get_p_value(obs_stat = original.F$statistic, direction = "greater")) #pvalue equals 0
```

## Challenge Two

### Step One

Creating `relative.beak.length` and `relative.tarsus.length` from the previously winnowed data set, I first ran two models using `lm()` to compare `log(Mass)` with `Beak.Length_Culmen` and `Tarsus.Length`. I then ran the `mutate()` function to add in the new variables as the `$residuals` from the two models I had already constructed

``` r
mbeak <- lm(log(Beak.Length_Culmen) ~ log(Mass), data = d)
mtarsus <- lm(log(Tarsus.Length) ~ log(Mass), data = d)
```

I then ran the `mutate()` function to add in the new variables as the `$residuals` from the two models I had already constructed

``` r
d <- d |> mutate(relative.beak.length = mbeak$residuals) |> 
  mutate(relative.tarsus.length = mtarsus$residuals) 
```

### Step Two

To visually asses these new variables I created a boxplot of **Primary Lifestyle \~ Relative Tarsus Length** and another boxplot of **Trophic Niche \~ Relative Beak Length.**

![](challenge2.21)

![](challenge2.22)

``` r
(p01<- ggplot(data = d |> drop_na(Primary.Lifestyle),
               aes(x = Primary.Lifestyle, y = relative.tarsus.length)) +
    geom_boxplot()) 
(p02 <- ggplot(data = d |> drop_na(Trophic.Niche),
               aes(x = Trophic.Niche, y = relative.beak.length)) +
    geom_boxplot())
```

### Step Three

Before I could run the requested ANOVA tests using range size, I needed to check for the normality of the data. Using a simple histogram (from the `hist()` function), I could tell this wasn't normally distributed and had to be logged when used in any future models.

![](challenge2.3)

I then omitted any NAs from `Migration` and turned into a factor again, as I had reloaded the data set between Challenge 1 and 2.

``` r
hist(d$Range.Size) #super not-normal i need to log it to be normal
d <- d |>
  na.omit(d$Migration) |>
  mutate(Migration = as.factor(Migration))
```

Running the new linear model comparing the log of range sizes by migration behavior returned an F-statistic of **510.5 on 2** and a p-value less than **2.2e-16.** This suggests that a bird's range size is strongly associated with its migration behavior.

Closer analysis shows that the reference level, birds that exhibit migration behavior 1, have significantly different range sizes than birds with either other migration behavior.

-   **Group 1 v. Group 2 P-value \<***2.2e-16*

-   **Group 1 v. Group 3 P-value \<***2.2e-16*

``` r
m3 <- lm(log(Range.Size) ~ Migration, data = d)
summary(m3) #all migration are different than the ref level [migration1] and the base is significant
#pvalue for m1 v. m2 [<2e-16]
#pvaulue for m1 v. m3 [<2e-16]
```

Releveling shows that birds in Group 2 also have significantly different range sizes than birds in Group 3 \[P-value = **3.74e-10**\]

``` r
d <- d |> mutate(Migration = relevel(Migration, ref = "2")) #switching ref level
(m32 <- lm(log(Mass) ~ Migration, data = d)) #comparing with new levels
summary(m32) #pvalue for m2 v. m3 [3.74e-10] 
```

Doing post-hoc analysis on `m3` , in the same fashion as was done on `m2`, shows that each migration behavior group has significantly different range sizes from each other with p-values equal to **0.00**.

``` r
m3 <- aov(log(Range.Size)~ Migration, data = d)
posthoc2 <- TukeyHSD(m3, which = "Migration", ordered = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)
posthoc2 #all significantly different with p-values at 0
```

### Step Four

Winnowing the data set to only include Passeriformes, I then created new boxplots to show the relationships between **Relative Beak Length** and **Primary Lifestlye** as well as **Trophic Level**

![](challenge2.41)

![](challenge2.42)

``` r
d <- d |>
  filter(Order1 == "Passeriformes")
(p03<- ggplot(data = d |> drop_na(Primary.Lifestyle),
              aes(x = Primary.Lifestyle, y = relative.beak.length)) +
    geom_boxplot()) 
(p04 <- ggplot(data = d |> drop_na(Trophic.Level),
               aes(x = Trophic.Level, y = relative.beak.length)) +
    geom_boxplot())
```

Running linear models with `lm()` on these same comparisons shows two high F-statistics with suggestive p-values.

-   **m4 F-Statistic =** *127.4 on 3*

    -   **p-value \<** *2.2e-16*

-   **m5 F-Statistic =** *171.4 on 2*

    -   **p-value \<** *2.2e-16*

Comparing the variables within each comparison, it appears that the birds with **Aerial** lifestyles have significantly different beak lengths than birds with **Generalist**, **Insessorial,** or **Terrestrial** lifestyles. Similarly, **Carnivorous** birds have significantly different beak lengths than their **Herbivorous** counterparts and **Omnivores** have mostly different average beak lengths but not as significantly different.

``` r
m4 <- lm(relative.beak.length ~ Primary.Lifestyle, data = d)
summary(m4) #very significant [<2e-16]
m5 <- lm(relative.beak.length ~ Trophic.Level, data = d)
summary(m5) ##very significant [<2e-16]
```

### Step Five

Switching over to `aov()` for a better summary of the model, I compared **Relative Beak Length** to **Primary Lifestyle** AND **Trophic Level**. The results indicate that a bird's trophic level does effect beak length with the bird's lifestyle is taken into account and vice versa

-   Trophic level's affect on beak length accounting for lifestyle - **p\<2e-16**

-   Primary lifestyle's affect on beak length accounting for trophic level - **p\<2e-16**

``` r
m6 <- aov(d$relative.beak.length ~ d$Primary.Lifestyle + d$Trophic.Level) #switched to AOV to better illustrate general trends between the variables instead of the individual classifications in each variable
summary(m6) #it looks like trophic level does effect beak length when lifestyle is taken into account [<2e-16] and vice versa [<2e-16]
```

### Step Six

Running the same model but adding an interaction term `:` between `Primary.Lifestyle` and `Trophic.Level` indicates a strong interaction between a bird's primary lifestyle and its trophic level.

-   **p-value for interaction** \< *2e-16*

This follows conventional wisdom but this analysis provides statistical evidence of this assumption

``` r
m7 <- aov(relative.beak.length ~ Primary.Lifestyle + Trophic.Level + Primary.Lifestyle:Trophic.Level, data = d)
summary(m7) #there appears to be strong interaction between a bird's lifestyle and it's trophic level.
```

### Step Seven

To better illustrate this interaction, I developed an interaction plot with the `interaction.plot()` function. This shows how a birds lifestyle affects relative beak length organized by trophic level.

![](challenge2.7)

``` r
interaction.plot(x.factor = d$Primary.Lifestyle, xlab = "Primary Lifestyle", trace.factor = d$Trophic.Level, trace.label = "Trophic Level",
                 response = d$relative.beak.length, fun = base::mean, ylab = "Relative Beak Length")
```

### Step Eight

Returning to the original ANOVAs that we ran, I need to check to see if they follow our expectations of what an ANOVA should have. Specifically, I'm looking to see if each variable has roughly equal variance AND a normal distribution of observations and residuals.

#### Looking at `m4`

First, I compare the highest standard deviation in beak length grouped by lifestyle and divided it by the lowest standard deviation in beak length grouped by lifestyle. This returned a value equal to **1.23** which means that the variance between grouped beak lengths is roughly equal.

``` r
PL <- d |>
  group_by(Primary.Lifestyle) |>
  summarize(sdlength = sd(relative.beak.length))
max(PL$sdlength)/min(PL$sdlength) #checking beak length for equal variance = all good (1.23)
```

Second, I look at a distribution of relative beak length observations and residuals grouped by birds with the Aerial lifestyle.

![](challenge2.81)

Visually assessing these distributions, it's clear the QQ plot is highly abnormal and the histogram of observations has a right skew. This likely effected our models.

``` r
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(d$relative.beak.length[d$Primary.Lifestyle == "Aerial"], main = "Aerial", xlab = "Relative Beak Length")
qqnorm(d$relative.beak.length[d$Primary.Lifestyle == "Aerial"]) #not normally distributed
```

I then repeated this for Generalist, Insessorial, and Terrestial birds.

![](challenge2.82)

While not as severe as the Aerial group, Generalist residuals are still odd and the histogram of observations has a noticeable right skew.

``` r
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(d$relative.beak.length[d$Primary.Lifestyle == "Generalist"], main = "Generalist", xlab = "Relative Beak Length")
qqnorm(d$relative.beak.length[d$Primary.Lifestyle == "Generalist"]) #mostly normal but a little skewed
```

Insessorial distributions look largely normal with a moderate right skew and some peculiarities in residuals.

![](challenge2.83)

``` r
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(d$relative.beak.length[d$Primary.Lifestyle == "Insessorial"], main = "Insessorial", xlab = "Relative Beak Length")
qqnorm(d$relative.beak.length[d$Primary.Lifestyle == "Insessorial"]) #pretty normal
```

Terrestrial group, much like the Generalists, have a noticeable right skew and some peculiarities in the residuals.

![](challenge2.84)

``` r
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(d$relative.beak.length[d$Primary.Lifestyle == "Terrestrial"], main = "Terrestrial", xlab = "Relative Beak Length")
qqnorm(d$relative.beak.length[d$Primary.Lifestyle == "Terrestrial"]) #mostly normal
```

Since all four of these distributions had some abnormality to them, it's likely that the ANOVAs run on `Primary.Lifestyle` were skewed in some way. However, as equal variance was found and most of abnormalities weren't extreme, this skew may not have been significant enough to dramatically effect our results.

#### Looking at `m5`

I then repeated the entire process for the Trophic Level analyses. This produced an equal variance score of **1.33** and the following distributions

**Carnivores**

The distribution of observations in the histogram is mostly normally distributed if sharply and with a minor right skew. It's the residuals in the Q-Q plot that look strange, with some notable outliers at the tails.

![](challenge2.85)

**Omnivores**

The distribution of observations in the histogram has a noticably right skew that may have effected our model. The Q-Q plot is also a little strange at the tails but not entirely abnormal.

![](challenge8.6)

**Herbivores**

While the distribution has a noticeable right skew, it isn't as severe as the Omnivores distribution and and the Q-Q plot is mostly normal with minimal oddities. Nonetheless this likely had an effect on any ANOVA run with this data.

![](challenge2.87)

Similarly to `m4`, all of these distributions had some abnormality to them. As such, it's likely that the ANOVAs run on `Trophic.Level` were skewed in some way. However, as equal variance was found and most of abnormalities weren't extreme, this skew may not have been significant enough to dramatically effect our results.

``` r
TL <- d |>
  group_by(Trophic.Level) |>
  summarize(sdlength = sd(relative.beak.length))
max(TL$sdlength)/min(TL$sdlength) #checking beak length for equal variance = all good (1.33)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(d$relative.beak.length[d$Trophic.Level == "Carnivore"], main = "Carnivore", xlab = "Relative Beak Length")
qqnorm(d$relative.beak.length[d$Trophic.Level == "Carnivore"]) #largely normally distributed
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(d$relative.beak.length[d$Trophic.Level == "Omnivore"], main = "Omnivore", xlab = "Relative Beak Length")
qqnorm(d$relative.beak.length[d$Trophic.Level == "Omnivore"]) #mostly normal
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(d$relative.beak.length[d$Trophic.Level == "Herbivore"], main = "Herbivore", xlab = "Relative Beak Length")
qqnorm(d$relative.beak.length[d$Trophic.Level == "Herbivore"]) #pretty normal with a little right skew
```
